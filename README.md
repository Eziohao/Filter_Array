# Filter_Array
A C++ program. I build this program to practice c++ and data structure.
There is an array which has 31 numbers, you need to compare each 3 numbers in this array. When you find 3 numbers has the 2 specific logic, you need to pick up 2 of these 3 numbers, and put them to an new array. Then you need to delete these two number in original array. Until the original one only has 3 numbers.
